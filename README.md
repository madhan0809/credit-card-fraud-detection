## About
Credit card fraud is a significant problem that costs financial institutions billions of dollars each year.Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool for detecting fraudulent transactions. 
This paper provides a comprehensive review of ML techniques that have been used for credit card fraud detection.We discuss the different types of ML algorithms that are used, as well as the different data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques that can be used to improve the performance of ML models.We also discuss the challenges of credit card fraud detection and the future directions for research in this area.

## Results and Impact
<!--Give the results and impact as shown below-->
 the main objective of this project was to find the most suited model in credit card fraud detection in terms of the machine learning techniques chosen for the project, and it was met by building the four models and finding the accuracies of them all, the best model in terms of accuracies is Support Vector Machine which scored 99.94% with only 51 misclassified instances. I believe that using the model will help in decreasing the amount of credit card fraud and increase the customers satisfaction as it will provide them with better experience in addition to feeling secure.
